# Overview

Want to do feature-based time-series analysis, fast, and in a coding language of your choice? The _catch22_ feature set provides open access to a powerful reduced set of time-series analysis features (extracted from the full _hctsa_ feature set) that compute quickly. **But** the features have long scary names that can be difficult to interpretâ€¦

** Welcome to a collection of **_**catch22**_** feature descriptions!**

In this document, we aim to explain the _catch22_ features in a clear and intuitive way, with plots and examples.

Being written in the beautiful gitbook platform, you can comment into the document if you have any questions or spot any errors.

Happy exploring!
